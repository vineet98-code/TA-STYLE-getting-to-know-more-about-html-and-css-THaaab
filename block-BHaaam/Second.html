  <h2>Main Goal Of Human Life</h2>
  <img src="goal.jpg" alt="Javascript" width = "250" height = "180" >
  <p>Faith in God and prescribed duty (karma) with an unselfish mind is considered as the main goal of human life. Material desires and attainment of joyful life shouldn’t be the highest goal of human life.  All beings are enforced to performed action in life. We should always focus on our duties rather than fruitful results. One should never hesitate while doing their duties because there’s nothing important than one’s personal duty in life. So get up ready to perform because nothing is easy in life. It is better to die for responsibilities and duties than to live an ordinary life without doing anything and ultimately die</p>
      <p>Always treats your pleasure and pain, gain and loss, victory and defeat alike in life. By doing your duty this way, you will never feel regret in life. The fruits of work should not be the motive. Perform your duty (karma) in life to the best of your strength as the order given by God without consideration for the personal pleasure or the fruits of your work.</p>
