  <p>Success is a full of fruitful desire that everybody wants but it doesn’t taught us life changing lesson and experience that we learn from failure. We celebrate it perhaps we never forget that what we have done to achieve it. For being successful, one has to be adaptable according to the situation and change itself at specific period of time.

Life is complicated & tough; one doesn’t have control on it. In every stages of life, life gives us many chance to become stronger even & self dependent to change our dark future. But most of them are just waiting and watching the life show of their life, instead of making some change what really matter in life. We can make it easier by doing consistent harder work on new ideas, concentrating without any distraction. </p>
